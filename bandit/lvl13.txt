The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can 
only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the 
next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. 
Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

here we have a private ssh key which we have to deliver to bandit14@localhost trough ssh

	1) ssh -i sshkey_private bandit14@localhost
		-> yes
		-> cat /etc/bandit_passwd/bandit14
