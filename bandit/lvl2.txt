The password for the next level is stored in a file called 
"spaces in this filename" located in the home directory


here we have a file with spaces, and a space it's a special character.
Therefore we have to find a way to skip those special characters.


	1)cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename  -> if we specify a \ followed by a space, we're
						basically skipping those special char.

	2)cat "spaces in this filename"  -> same idea, but using double quotes

	3) cat sp*   -> here i'm asking to cat a file starting with sp and whatever thing follows
	4) cat *me   -> same idea but backwards
	5) cat *this*   -> same idea but here is like saying "there is something, 
				then a certain string then somtheing else".

	6) cat $(pwd)/*  -> same as lvl1
