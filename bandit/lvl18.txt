The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. 
Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.


here when we try to log in via SSH, the server kicks us out before we have the chance to
insert a command. So here we can input a comand in the same line where we use ssh to connect to

	1) ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 bash

		-> notice the "bash" parameter, so we could've input a "ls" command
			then a car on the readme file, and so on..
		-> but rather we pop a bash shell that way we interact with server in a better way
