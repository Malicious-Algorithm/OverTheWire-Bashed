There is a git repository at ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo. 
The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

well this was rough, did not know what to do
but i was told that git has tags that set a unique state (??) 

bueno en realidad marcan "hitos"
	1) git tag
	2) git show secret
