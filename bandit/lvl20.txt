There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that 
does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the 
port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of 
text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If 
the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think


here it was tricky for me, i had to google how to do it 'cause i was hitting my head against the wall

	1) ./suconnect 5432
		-> but we had to connect again and nc -nlvp 5432
			->then submmit the password and he sent it back
