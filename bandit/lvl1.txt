The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located 
in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. 
Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that 
level and continue the game.


Here i have to deal with special characters, how can i read a file named: -
well i can do:
	1) cat ./-    -> and what i'm basically asking is, from the present directory
				read the file named -
	
	2)cat ./*     -> the same idea, but here i'm using a wild card that says
				"cat all the files in the present directory".

	3)more ./-
	4)cat /home/bandit1/-  -> here we are reading from path.
	
	5)cat $(pwd)/-	    -> we know that "pwd" command gives us the path we're currently in
				so we can specify to cat a "Syscall" followed by the file we 
					want to read.

	6)cat $(pwd)/*	    -> same as before but using a wild card.
