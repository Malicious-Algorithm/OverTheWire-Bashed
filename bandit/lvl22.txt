A program is running automatically at regular intervals 
from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command 
is being executed.

NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script 
for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what 
it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.


we have to read the script and cat the file 

	1) bandit22@bandit:/etc/cron.d$ cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh
		#!/bin/bash

		myname=$(whoami)
		mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
		echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"
		cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
	
	So if we do like: echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
		it give us this md5 hash: 8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

	and now we can cat that file:

		bandit22@bandit:/$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
