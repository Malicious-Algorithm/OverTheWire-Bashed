To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. 
Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be 
found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

here we have a setud binary which we can "exploit" per say. 
	a setuid binary can execute commands at level of the owner of the file.
	and this is quite dangerous beacose we can do sth like this:
	
	1) ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
