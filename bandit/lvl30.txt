There is a git repository at ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo. 
The password for the user bandit29-git is the same as for the user bandit29

here we have to clone the repo but there is a catch

	README.md does not gives us the flag
	
	and git log -p neither

so we have to take a look at all the branches 
	
	1) git branch -r

	2) git checkout dev

	3) cat README.md

flag: 5b90576bedb2cc04c86a9e924ce42faf
