The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password 
of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.


here we can't do 
	echo "<passwrd"> | nc localhost 30001

beacose the connection is encrypted, we have to do

	1) openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
