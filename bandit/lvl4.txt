The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory. 
Tip: if your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.

here we have to look for ASCII text so

	1) file inhere/* 
		cat -file07   -> first we ask about which context have those files
					then we cat out the file with the output: ASCII

	2) file inhere/-file0* | grep "ASCII" | awk -F: '{print $1}' | xargs cat
				-> here we ask find to output the context of the files
				    then we grep only the ones that returned ASCII
				      then we grab the first argument with awk $1
					then we cat that file in paralel. 

	let's take it slowly
		So we have this command 
			
			-> file inhere/-file0* | grep "ASCII"
				outputs: inhere/-file07: ASCII text
		
		Then we have | awk -F: '{print $1}'
				outputs: inhere/-file07

		Lastly we have | xargs cat
