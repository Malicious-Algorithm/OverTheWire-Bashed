There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo. 
The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

here all we can see inside of README.md is:

	 username: bandit29
	 password: xxxxxxxxxx

so we have to find a way to read the changes that have been made

	1) git log -p 

- username: bandit29
-- password: bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2
+- password: xxxxxxxxxx

flag: bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2
