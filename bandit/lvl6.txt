The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and 
has all of the following properties:

    owned by user bandit7
    owned by group bandit6
    33 bytes in size

here we have to search through the root dir

	1) find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null | xargs cat
		-> we had to deal with stderr, Stderr report to us all the err msg
			that's why we send all of 'em to /dev/null 
			  and then we cat the file 

		-> if we want to see the err msg we have to convert the Stderr to Stdin
			with 2>&1
