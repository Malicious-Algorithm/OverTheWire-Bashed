The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to 
a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these 
ports have a server listening on them. Then 
find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server 
that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.


so here we have to use nmap to dicover ports that speaks SSL

	1)nmap -sC -sV -p31000-32000 localhost -v
	
		-> port 31790 was the one, it gave us a private ssh key!
		-> we save it into
	2) mkdtemp -d
		-> nano id_rsa -> save it
	3) chmod 600 id_rsa
	4) ssh -i id_rsa bandit17@localhost

/*no flag here, ind i ain't posting the rsa key on this document...*/
