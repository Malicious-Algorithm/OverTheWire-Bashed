A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. 
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script

here we have to create our own shell scritp, easy shell script

	1) cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.<sth>/passwrd.txt

	->we had to chmod o+xrw the tmp folder we were in
	->send a copy to the directory where the scripts are executed then deleted
	->and we got it!
