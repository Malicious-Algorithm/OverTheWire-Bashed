Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell 
for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. 
Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.


I did not quite understand the concept of "paying" beacose of the "more" command
Definetly should read --more-- about this issue 

	but here we can minimize the size of the terminal to get advantage of 
	the more command. 
		
	1) type: v   then tpye:  : set shell=/bin/bash   then: enter   then :shell
	
	-> that sequence should spawn us a bash shell
		
	so now we have a stuid binary which can run commands as bandit27

	1) ./bandit27-do bash -p

		-> here the thing is that we are bandit26 and cannot run commands as bandit27

		-> so we provide de -p flag that says "if -p is supplied, the startup
			behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset"

		"eso quiere decir que cuando corra el .sh , no se me va a resetear el user a 
			bandit 26, sino que va a tomar el usser que owns ese script!"
