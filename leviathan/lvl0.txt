Leviathan’s levels are called leviathan0, leviathan1, … etc. and can be accessed on leviathan.labs.overthewire.org 
through SSH on port 2223.

To login to the first level use:

Username: leviathan0
Password: leviathan0

Well, we just log into the server using those creds

	1) ssh leviathan0@leviathan.labs.overthewire.org -p 2223


here we can see a hidden folder 

	2) ls -la

there is a .backup/ folder

	3) ls .backups/

there is a file page.html

	4) cat .backup/page.html

and there is a lot of text here, obviously html sintax, so we can use "grep"

	5) cat .backup/page.html | grep "password"
