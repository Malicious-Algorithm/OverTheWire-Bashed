# OverTheWire-Bashed
OverTheWire.org it's a web page where I practice mi Bashing skills through levels.

  For each level i had to implement certain bash commands in the command line in order to get to the next level.
  You'll see me struggling in some of them, specially towards the end where it gets a little bit hard.
  
Come take a look :D !
