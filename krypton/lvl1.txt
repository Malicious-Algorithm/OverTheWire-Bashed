The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. 
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.
 When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to 
group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. 
This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!
