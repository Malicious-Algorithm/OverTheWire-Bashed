This level it's very similar to natas6 where we're asked to input a text or a "secret"

Let's look at the source code first:

<?

$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>


So the secret is encoded in various formats:
	
	First let's decode bin2Hex this string -> 3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362
		which gives us: -> ==QcCtmMml1ViV3b
	
	Sencond lets reverse that string
		giving: -> b3ViV1lmMmtCcQ==   (it's very obvious this is base64)
	
	Thirdly decode in base64 that last string 
		giving: -> oubWYf2kBq


And lastly let's input that string. As expected here is the password:

	-> Access granted. The password for natas9 is W0mMhUcRRnG8dcghE4qvk3JA9lGt8nDl
