Now it's getting a bit trickier, there's nothing on the source code of the page but an endpoint where there is a png.

Inside this endpoint there are 2 files stored: 
http://natas2.natas.labs.overthewire.org/files/
	-> pixel.png
	-> users.txt

Reading users.txt we get the password to the next level:
