In this level we have to use BurpSuite to capture the request we're sending to the host

We're pompted with this message afte we log in with pevious creds.

-> Access disallowed. You are visiting from "http://natas4.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php" 
while authorized users should come only from "http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/"


So we know we have to make natas4 beleive we're making a GET request from natas5
I used Burp to do this. 


//Burp intercepts the request, and gives this info
GET /index.php HTTP/1.1

Taking a closer look at the "Refer" header, we know we have to modify this field to: http://natas5.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
Forward the request with the modified field and the password is now showing!
