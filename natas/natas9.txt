This level ask us to input a word and display words starting with whatever word we give it
let's take a look at the code and how it does it:

	<form>
		Find words containing: 
			<input name=needle><input type=submit name=submit value=Search><br><br>
	</form>


Output:
<pre>
<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");    //->(this fuction execute whatever command we input)
}
?>

So if we input something like: 
	-> a; echo "hola!"
		it's going to return the output of the words on the dictionary matching the word "a" AND it's going to execute
			the command echo. And this is the issue.

	Knowing this, we can read the file from /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 and we know this route works bc of natas lvl7!
