We're asked to input a secret in a <input> html tag. Since we don't know the secret let's take a look at the source code of the page

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>

<div id="viewsource"><a href="index-source.html">View sourcecode</a></div>

And:

<?

include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

<form method=post>
Input secret: <input name=secret><br>
<input type=submit name=submit>
</form>


So in the firs line inside the PHP tags, it's including a file fom "includes/secret.inc"
and checking if the "secret" is the same we're sending trough the POST request inside the <form> tag from above.

Let's check that file:
	->http://natas6.natas.labs.overthewire.org/includes/secret.inc
		
		<?
		   $secret = "FOEIUWGHFEEUHOFUOIU";
		?>

And that's the secret we have to input on the <input> tag inside the <form> !


		->Access granted. The password for natas7 is 7z3hEENjQtflzgnT29q7wAvMNfZdh0i9
