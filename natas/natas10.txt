This level was really hard for me, i did a lot of research about how to bypass this code:

<?
$key = "";

if(array_key_exists("needle", $_REQUEST)) {
    $key = $_REQUEST["needle"];
}

if($key != "") {
    if(preg_match('/[;|&]/',$key)) {
        print "Input contains an illegal character!";
    } else {
        passthru("grep -i $key dictionary.txt");
    }
}
?>

The inyection point is at passthru("grep -i   -> $key <- ..). I tried lots of things but gave up the day after.
So the payload was as simple as this (i was frustrated once i saw the solution):
	-> .* /etc/natas_webpass/natas10 #

Its trying to grep everithing on the directory along with the route where the password is and # to ignore the "dictionary.txt"); section of the code.
