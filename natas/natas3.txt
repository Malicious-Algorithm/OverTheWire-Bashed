In the source code of the page we get this announce:
	<!-- No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time... -->

So i'm thinking about robots.txt file.
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/robots.txt

And here we get an inteesting endpoint we can take a look
http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/s3cr3t/

And inside the previous endpoint we find the "users.txt" file where we can read the password!
